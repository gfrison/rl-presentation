\frametitle{Deep Reinforcement Learning}
Deep  learning  enables  RL  to  scale  to  decision-making
problems  that  were  previously  intractable,  i.e.,  settings  with
high-dimensional  state  and  action  spaces. \cite{arulkumaran2017brief}

^^INeural networks can learn the approximated value of $\mathbf{V_s}$ or $\mathbf{Q(s, a)}$ for any given \textsc{state/action space}.
